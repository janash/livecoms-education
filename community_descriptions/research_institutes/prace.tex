Over several years, PRACE (\href{https://prace-ri.eu/}{https://prace-ri.eu/}) has developed an extensive Training Portal (\href{https://training.prace-ri.eu/}{https://training.prace-ri.eu/}) where visitors can explore upcoming training events and find a range of other HPC-related training resources.
The events and resources are offered at different levels of proficiency in the use of HPC, but can be of relevance to any scientific field or industrial domain that relies on supercomputers.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, all PRACE-supported training events were reformatted for online-only participation. 
PRACE remains committed to delivering most courses online but a small number of courses will allow hybrid (in-person and online) participation since September 2021.
PRACE training courses are open to participants affiliated with institutions from the Member States (MS) of the European Union (EU) and \href{https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/statistics/framework-programme-facts-and-figures/horizon-2020-country-profiles_en}{Associated/Other Countries} to the Horizon 2020 programme.
PRACE also supports the International HPC Summer School (\href{https://www.ihpcss.org/}{https://www.ihpcss.org/}).
Looking towards the future, PRACE is currently working with the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking 
(\href{https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/index_en}{https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/index\_en}).
on a professional HPC traineeship programme, which is planned to start in 2024.
