The \href{https://winterschool.cc}{Virtual Winter School on Computational Chemistry} (VWSCC) is an online conference series and community. Founded in 2015, the core aim of VWSCC is to improve the accessibility of scientific research to the scientific community all over the world by removing many of the traditional barriers to conference attendance - geography, income, career stage and many others. As well as offering access to talks combining pedagogical content and cutting-edge research developments, the VWSCC has been creating and maintaining an archive of education resources and running hands-on workshops for a variety of quantum chemical codes.  Participation is free and includes an online poster session. In this paper\cite{ROOS2020112975}, we discuss the reach of the VWSCC, some of the resources we offer and how to get involved in the community, an evaluation of how to run successful and accessible online events, and a summary of some of the challenges of working within this format.
