The Partnership for Integration of Computation into Undergraduate Physics (PICUP) is dedicated to the principle that computation should be an integral part of the education of every undergraduate physics student. Their mission is to foster a vibrant community of educators, provide a forum for open discussion, build a repository of educational resources, and offer strategies to support the development and enhancement of undergraduate physics education by integrating computation across the curriculum.

PICUP's approach is to increase the use of computation in individual physics courses. They acknowledge that computation is indispensable for physicists in the 21st century, and it must be an integral part of physics education. In pursuit of their goals, PICUP develops computational packages that are intricately connected with the subject matter of popular physics texts and removes the barriers to the adoption and customization of educational materials. PICUP's partnership consists of a diverse team of physics instructors who share an interest and a commitment to the integration of computation into undergraduate courses, representing the wide range of institutional types and departmental environments across the country. PICUP provides direct support through professional development opportunities, including workshops (both in-person and virtual) and longer departmental and regional retreats.
