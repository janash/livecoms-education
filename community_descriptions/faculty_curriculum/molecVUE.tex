The MoleCVUE consortium is an association of faculty at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) who share the common purpose expressed by our name: Molecular Computation and Visualization in Undergraduate Education. 
Participants at recent events have come from a variety of academic institutions including in faculty and students alike. 
Our areas of interest include not only chemistry, but also any area where the ruling paradigm is “molecules.” 
Our objectives are to enhance our own undergraduate instruction by developing and employing modern computational and visualization tools and to provide the methods, techniques, and resources we develop freely to other science instructors.

The MoleCVUE consortium strives to provide a community for expressing one’s own ideas and receiving constructive criticism from peer educators. Our \href{https://sites.google.com/view/molecvue/events?authuser=0}{website} hosts \href{https://sites.google.com/view/molecvue/resources?authuser=0}{curated resources} for incorporating computational chemistry into your curriculum. We host hybrid meetings and symposia with a workshop format to facilitate collaborations between participants and to hone existing educational methods and tools. We actively develop computational chemistry activities for the modern chemistry learning space.
