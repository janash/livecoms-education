Enhancing Science Courses by Integrating Python (ESCIP) is a resource and a community of instructors who work together to lower the barriers for integrating computational science concepts and skills into STEM courses. 
We aim to help bridge the increasing gap between computational skills in demand and skills taught at universities. 
The \href{https://escip.github.io/}{ESCIP website} contains a centralized resource hosted in Github as a Jupyter-book. 
The Jupyter book binds together self-contained single-lecture Jupyter notebooks created and edited, and used by different instructors to teach STEM courses. 
All notebooks can be run in the cloud via binder or GoogleColab, which allows instructors new to Python to focus on playing to the strength of their subject by emphasizing deep links between basic science and math concepts and data science techniques. 
Furthermore, the resources of ESCIP provide a natural context and ready-to-use tools for integrating computation, simulation, and data science that feels familiar and accessible to students and instructors.
