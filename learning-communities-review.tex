\begin{document}

\begin{frontmatter}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This particular document provides a skeleton illustrating key sections for a Perpetual Review document.
Please see the sample \texttt{sample-document.tex} in \url{github.com/livecomsjournal/article_templates/templates} for additional information on and examples of using the LiveCoMS LaTeX class.
Here we also assume familiarity with LaTeX and knowledge of how to include figures, tables, etc.; if you want examples, see the sample just referenced.

In your work, in this particular slot, please provide an abstract of no more than 250 words.
Your abstract should explain the main contributions of your article, and should not contain any material that is not included in the main text.
Please note that your abstract, plus the authorship material following it, must not extend beyond the title page or modifications to the LaTeX class will likely be needed.
\end{abstract}

\end{frontmatter}


\section{Introduction}

Here you would explain what area you are reviewing, and motivate your review.

In this particular template, we have removed most of the usage examples which occur in \texttt{sample-document.tex} to provide a minimal template you can modify.

Keep in mind, as you prepare your manuscript, that you should plan for a representative image  which will be used to highlight your article on the journal website and publications. Usually, this would be one of your figures, but it must also be uploaded separately upon article submission. We give specific guidelines for this image on the journal website in the section on article submission (see \url{https://livecomsjournal.github.io/authors/policies/index.html#article-submission}).

Additionally, for well-formatted manuscripts, we recommend that you let LaTeX handle figure/table placement for you as much as possible, so please avoid specifying strenuous float instructions like `[h!]` and `[H]` as much as possible.

\section{Review organization}

This Perpetual Review presents educational communities and resources in the computational molecular sciences.

\subsection{Perpetual review}

You will probably want to devote at least a small amount of space explaining to your readers what a Perpetual Review is and highlighting how they can get involved via your git issue tracker or by communicating with you directly.
In contrast to a traditional review, here it \emph{will} help you if the community points out other, related work that perhaps should be cited, since it reduces the need for you to dig deeply into the literature to keep your work up to date.

Tutorials should endeavor to cover the specific task at hand, and also highlight how the steps might need to be modified (or additional care might need to be taken at particular points) to handle more general cases.

The scope of the tutorial, as well as the expected proficiencies / outcomes for researchers who complete the tutorial, should be clearly defined.
This will often happen in a specific section or subsection in the article itself.

\section{Criteria for Inclusion}

%In keeping with other types of articles at LiveCoMS, it may be useful (at your discretion) to note any prerequisites your article assumes and who it is targeted at.

This article is aimed at improving the centralization of resources for computational molecular sciences. It is designed for both students and educators, and has a particular focus on resources that create learning communities. 

In order to decide what education resources and communities are in the article, we, the article maintainers created a set of minimum eligibility criteria for inclusion.
We based these criteria on openness, accessibility, and the existence of community around the learning resources. There are four main items in the minimum eligibility criteria. These are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The learning resources should be developed by multiple people or a community of people, rather than representing the efforts of a single individual.
\item The community should affiliated with an academic organization or multiple academic institutions. This essentially means that commercial learning resources are not represented in this review.
\item The community should provide resources explaining concepts beyond the software/tools used for calculations.
\item The community should use open licenses for educational resources (e.g. CC-BY). 
\end{itemize}

Considering the implicit diversity of educational communities we expect that one size does not fit all, but all educational communities and organizations listed here satisfy at least one criterion in each of the following four domains: accessibility, activity, growth and pedagogy. %Should we include the link to public survey here, for people to self-determine if they count? I have added it below -A

%To self-determine if you fulfill the criteria, we have provided a public survey here: %% this will be in the pull request template, we won't keep this form live.

%\url{https://molssi.typeform.com/to/vSSii68D?typeform-source=t.co}

\subsection{Accessibility}
The community should provide accessible resources and a responsive attitude towards trainees with diverse needs. At the bare minimum, this means that all softwares/tools that are being used in learning activities are open-source or free for academic use and/or most trainees have easy access to the computational tools that are being taught. 
\subsection{Activity}
The community should actively organize activities or offer resources that can be used for activities by others. These activities can be online resources or virtual/in-person events. In the case of the former, the community should provide online resources that are accessible to learners and/or educators. It is acceptable if the instructor resources have limited distribution, i.e. one must register as an instructor to the community to gain access. In the case of the latter, the community should organize regular events that are open to students, researchers, and/or educators.
\subsection{Growth} 
The community must be capable of growing and being sustainable. This can be in the form of training new members, educators and/or contributors. Alternatively, the community could offer a way to get involved by contributing and editing resources, or attending events, and should provide this information publicly.
\subsection{Pedagogy}
The community should pay attention to the teaching style used in their resources. The resources should include clearly-defined learning objectives and/or offer support for learners past specific learning activities. The support could be via a mailing list, online forum or an issue tracker.
\subsection{Updates}
As this is a Perpetual Review, the contents will be updated annually with new or updated contributions. To be included in the article in the future, or to update your contribution, please open a Pull Request on this repository. The Pull Request will contain a template with this criteria that you can fill out. 

A review author will review your Pull Request and guide you through a contribution given that you fulfill the above requirements for a learning community. 

\section{Education Communities}

We have divided the educational communities and resources into three broad categories based on the type of community an resources available:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Curriculum Development and Faculty Communities} - These represent communities of educators and often develop and offer curricula for university-level courses.
    \item \textbf{Tutorials, Schools, and Online Resources} - These are workshops, tutorials, or schools that are usually targeted at computational molecular sciences researchers. 
    \item \textbf{Research Centers and Institutes}
\end{itemize}
