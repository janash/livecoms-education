\begin{frontmatter}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This particular document provides a skeleton illustrating key sections for a Perpetual Review document.
Please see the sample \texttt{sample-document.tex} in \url{github.com/livecomsjournal/article_templates/templates} for additional information on and examples of using the LiveCoMS LaTeX class.
Here we also assume familiarity with LaTeX and knowledge of how to include figures, tables, etc.; if you want examples, see the sample just referenced.

In your work, in this particular slot, please provide an abstract of no more than 250 words.
Your abstract should explain the main contributions of your article, and should not contain any material that is not included in the main text.
Please note that your abstract, plus the authorship material following it, must not extend beyond the title page or modifications to the LaTeX class will likely be needed.
\end{abstract}

\end{frontmatter}




\section{Introduction}

Here you would explain what area you are reviewing, and motivate your review.

In this particular template, we have removed most of the usage examples which occur in \texttt{sample-document.tex} to provide a minimal template you can modify.

Keep in mind, as you prepare your manuscript, that you should plan for a representative image  which will be used to highlight your article on the journal website and publications. Usually, this would be one of your figures, but it must also be uploaded separately upon article submission. We give specific guidelines for this image on the journal website in the section on article submission (see \url{https://livecomsjournal.github.io/authors/policies/index.html#article-submission}).

Additionally, for well-formatted manuscripts, we recommend that you let LaTeX handle figure/table placement for you as much as possible, so please avoid specifying strenuous float instructions like `[h!]` and `[H]` as much as possible.

\section{Review organization}

In general the organization of your review is up to you.
LiveCoMS reviews are similar to traditional reviews except that they are updatable.

\subsection{Perpetual review}

You will probably want to devote at least a small amount of space explaining to your readers what a Perpetual Review is and highlighting how they can get involved via your git issue tracker or by communicating with you directly.
In contrast to a traditional review, here it \emph{will} help you if the community points out other, related work that perhaps should be cited, since it reduces the need for you to dig deeply into the literature to keep your work up to date.

Tutorials should endeavor to cover the specific task at hand, and also highlight how the steps might need to be modified (or additional care might need to be taken at particular points) to handle more general cases.

The scope of the tutorial, as well as the expected proficiencies / outcomes for researchers who complete the tutorial, should be clearly defined.
This will often happen in a specific section or subsection in the article itself.

\section{Prerequisites}

In keeping with other types of articles at LiveCoMS, it may be useful (at your discretion) to note any prerequisites your article assumes and who it is targeted at.

\section{Education Communities}

The education communities fall into two broad categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Curriculum Development and Faculty Communities
    \item Research Training - Tutorials and Schools
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Curriculum Development and Faculty Communities}

\subsubsection{Biochemistry Authentic Laboratory Scientific Inquiry (BASIL)}

\textbf{Contributed by Bonnie Hall}

The \href{(https://www.basilbiochem.org/home)}{Biochemistry Authentic Scientific Inquiry Laboratory (BASIL)} is a course-based research experience (CURE) that uses computational techniques and traditional laboratory methods to assign functions to proteins \cite{Roberts2019}. 
The BASIL curriculum aims to get students to transition from thinking like students to thinking like scientists. 
Students analyze proteins with known structures but unknown functions, using modules for computational analyses and/or wet-lab techniques. 
BASIL is designed for undergraduate biochemistry lab courses, but can be adapted to first year (or even high school) settings, as well as upper-level undergraduate or graduate coursework. It is relevant for students in biology, biochemistry, chemistry, or related majors. The curriculum is flexible, allowing module(s) to be used in any order and for only select modules to be utilized.
The BASIL Community provides curricular materials and instructor support for teaching biochemistry laboratory courses using course-based research. Computational and wet lab modules are available on the \href{https://www.basilbiochem.org/basil-modules}{BASIL Modules page}. 
BASIL also offers a variety of professional development activities throughout the year to help instructors learn about and implement our curriculum. This includes a \href{https://join.slack.com/t/onlinebasildiscussion/shared_invite/zt-1skdrd7br-x9MWjHCcNjmV0gkNftNMaw}{Slack channel to connect with the community}, learn more about BASIL, ask questions, and get help with using modules in your course.

\subsubsection{Enhancing Science Courses by Integrating Python (ESCIP)}

\textbf{Contributed by Davit Potoyan}

Enhancing Science Courses by Integrating Python (ESCIP) is a resource and a community of instructors who work together to lower the barriers for integrating computational science concepts and skills into STEM courses. 
We aim to help bridge the increasing gap between computational skills in demand and skills taught at universities. 
The \href{https://escip.github.io/}{ESCIP website} contains a centralized resource hosted in Github as a Jupyter-book. 
The Jupyter book binds together self-contained single-lecture Jupyter notebooks created and edited, and used by different instructors to teach STEM courses. 
All notebooks can be run in the cloud via binder or GoogleColab, which allows instructors new to Python to focus on playing to the strength of their subject by emphasizing deep links between basic science and math concepts and data science techniques. 
Furthermore, the resources of ESCIP provide a natural context and ready-to-use tools for integrating computation, simulation, and data science that feels familiar and accessible to students and instructors.


\subsubsection{MolecVUE}

\textbf{Contributed by Kevin M. Range}

The MoleCVUE consortium is an association of faculty at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) who share the common purpose expressed by our name: Molecular Computation and Visualization in Undergraduate Education. 
Participants at recent events have come from a variety of academic institutions including in faculty and students alike. 
Our areas of interest include not only chemistry, but also any area where the ruling paradigm is “molecules.” 
Our objectives are to enhance our own undergraduate instruction by developing and employing modern computational and visualization tools and to provide the methods, techniques, and resources we develop freely to other science instructors.

The MoleCVUE consortium strives to provide a community for expressing one’s own ideas and receiving constructive criticism from peer educators. Our \href{https://sites.google.com/view/molecvue/events?authuser=0}{website} hosts \href{curated resources}{https://sites.google.com/view/molecvue/resources?authuser=0} for incorporating computational chemistry into your curriculum. We host hybrid meetings and symposia with a workshop format to facilitate collaborations between participants and to hone existing educational methods and tools. We actively develop computational chemistry activities for the modern chemistry learning space.


\subsubsection{Psi4Education}

\textbf{Contributed by Brandon Magers}

Psi4Education is the education and outreach program of \href{psicode.org}{Psi4}, 
a free, open-source quantum chemistry software package.  Our goal is to provide a suite of free, high-quality, computational chemistry lab activities suitable across undergraduate chemistry courses without requiring a significant overhaul of the existing curriculum. 
Through these activities, Psi4Education aims to increase exposure to computational chemistry and scientific programming for undergraduate chemistry majors.  
The use of computing skills is becoming increasingly important in modern research. 
Most high-impact articles combine computation with experiment, implying that even modern experimental researchers must be at least literate in many of the finer details of computational chemistry. 
Additionally, scientific programming is standard in other disciplines (such as physics) and provides students with another tool available to help them enhance their problem-solving skills. 
A generation ago, including spreadsheets in chemical education enhanced chemical problem-solving, and scientific programming promises to do the same for contemporary students. 
Finally, computational chemistry is a fantastic educational tool to teach students chemistry. 
The ability to visualize changing geometries, the actual motions of atomic vibrations, and the spatial extent and nodal structure of molecular orbitals, among many others, are examples of chemical concepts that can increase student comprehension through a mathematical and graphical presentation followed by manipulation afforded through chemical computation.

The Psi4Education community comprises faculty, graduate students, undergraduate students, and research scientists from across the United States and even the world beyond.  
We encourage joining our community on \href{https://github.com/Psi4Education}{GitHub}.  
Every laboratory exercise and activity is freely available and open-source.  
All activities are web-based through Jupyter Notebooks or WebMO and are locally software-installation-free to lower the barrier to implementation in a classroom setting.  
Concepts on bond breaking, the Hartree-Fock method, atomic radii, polarity, symmetry, and machine learning are only a few currently available activities.  
These exercises are primarily focused on physical chemistry, but concepts related to general, organic, and inorganic chemistry are all available. 
However, the Psi4Edication community is encouraging and welcoming to those who wish to add and augment these exercises with contributions of their own.

\subsection{Workshops and Schools}

\subsubsection{Helsinki Winter School in Theoretical Chemistry}

\textbf{Contributed by Susi Lehtola}

The \href{http://www.chem.helsinki.fi/ws.html}{Helsinki Winter School in
Theoretical Chemistry} has been organized annually
since 1985 at the \href{http://www.chem.helsinki.fi/}{Department of Chemistry}
of the \href{www.helsinki.fi/}{University of Helsinki}, Finland, with the
exception of 2020 and 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The theme of the
Winter School changes from year to year, in order to cover various fields of
theoretical chemistry as well as possible. For example, the last four schools
covered quantum computers for chemistry (2022), inorganic chemistry (2019),
machine learning in theoretical chemistry (2018), and current trends in
electronic structure methods (2017). The school aims to invite the leading 
experts in the field, guaranteeing lectures of high scientific quality. The
lecture materials are typically only made available to the workshop attendees,
so that lecturers feel more free to present unpublished results.

The winter school is typically organized in late October to early December as a
four-day event, and usually has around 80 participants, around half of whom come
from abroad. The school is targeted for PhD students and young researchers, but
they usually also include a few more established researchers and professors; the
presence of the more senior personnel often leads to lively scientific
discussions during the lectures. Participation in the winter school is free;
however, attendees need to pay their own travel and accomodation. The school
also features a poster session, which welcomes posters representing any area of
theoretical chemistry.

\subsubsection{Making it rain}

\textbf{Contributed by Pablo Arantes}

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely used for describing biomolecular motion, employing a classic physics approximation to depict atomic trajectories \cite{Liu2017,Hollingsworth2018}. However, due to their high computational demands, there is an increasing effort to enable large-scale runs of MD simulations \cite{Hollingsworth2018}. Cloud computing has emerged as a potential solution due to its scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness \cite{Ebejer2013}. Nevertheless, utilizing cloud computing for MD simulations requires technical expertise and the ability to perform tedious tasks, such as configuring remote nodes and installing software. To address this challenge, we developed a user-friendly front-end for running MD simulations \cite{Arantes2021} using the OpenMM toolkit \cite{Eastman2017} on the Google Colab framework \cite{colab,Bisong2019} (\url{https://pablo-arantes.github.io/making-it-rain/}). Our approach involves shareable, ready-to-use, and customizable Jupyter notebooks that guide the end-user through the process of running their calculations on the Google Colab platform. This approach makes it more accessible for low-income research groups to perform MD simulations at the microsecond timescale, and also facilitates teaching and learning of molecular simulations. These protocols can be customized for specific use cases, providing students with a hands-on approach to learning MD simulations.

We believe that our work has a significant impact in the scientific community by enabling more researchers to conduct MD simulations without the high cost of traditional computing resources. This approach is also valuable for educators who wish to provide students with a hands-on experience in MD simulations. In summary, our approach offers an affordable and accessible solution for performing MD simulations using cloud computing resources. We hope that this strategy will empower researchers and educators alike, ultimately leading to new insights and discoveries in the field of biomolecular dynamics.

All notebooks presented here are freely and publicly available at  \url{https://pablo-arantes.github.io/making-it-rain/}.

\subsubsection{The eChem Project}

\textbf{Contributed by Patrick Norman}

The eChem project offers a platform for interactive studies in computational chemistry based on Jupyter notebooks and the use of modern Python-driven electronic structure softwares such as VeloxChem  and Gator.  The notebooks are compiled into a Jupyter Book that targets a wide audience ranging from undergraduate students to experienced researchers.  The central educational idea of eChem is to leverage the Python-layer exposure of data structures in VeloxChem and other software modules to enable the study of quantum chemistry in a similar manner that NumPy (or Matlab) can be used in studies of linear algebra. Presentations of theory and equations are intertwined with notebook cells showing the form these equations take in Python code implementations and fundamental concepts such as two-particle densities and electron correlation can be made visual with use of Matplotlib illustrations. 

While the eChem book is well suited for self-directed learning, the material can also be used to put together workshops led by experienced instructors or as components in standard courses in the chemistry curriculum.  Students are recommended to use conda to install the software on their own laptops running Windows, MacOS, or Linux. 
The eChem book is published under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license with the source code available on GitHub.  Community contributions to the project are welcome both as comments and corrections as well as new book sections. The former category is handled through GitHub whereas the latter is initiated by e-mail correspondence to one of the authors.

\subsubsection{The Institute of Computational Molecular Science Education}

\textbf{Contributed by Neeraj Rai}

The Institute of Computational Molecular Science Education (i-CoMSE, \href{www.i-comse.org}{www.i-comse.org}) was established with funding from an NSF Cybertraining grant, and focuses on serving the needs of the community engaged in fundamental research in computational molecular science and engineering (CMSE) by (a) providing an ecosystem for nurturing and training the next generation of computational molecular scientists and engineers, (b) increasing availability and accessibility of well-curated education material and content, (c) serving as a node for engagement with the relevant stakeholders and promoting fundamental research in CMSE, and (d) broadening participation through recruitment and training of underrepresented groups in CMSE at institutions with low cyberinfrastructure (CI) penetration. 
The institute provides training and educational modules for guided training in advanced computational tools and bolsters the fundamental understanding of the underlying theoretical concepts. Specifically, we offer (1) summer/winter schools for hands-on training on advanced computational techniques and enhancing peer networking for early-stage researchers, and DEI training (2) web-based content to support training at a larger scale, and (3) curriculum and instructional materials for senior undergraduate (UG) and graduate courses to support course development across the community. The planned Summer/winter schools and course materials include modeling approaches spanning different length and time scales (quantum mechanics, atomistic modeling, mesoscale simulations) and advanced data analysis tools, including machine learning. 

 We encourage community members to explore our website for information on past and future schools and materials developed by the institute. If you are an instructor looking for content for your class or course offering, you intend to teach a particular topic, or wish to join for trainer training please email info@i-comse.org
