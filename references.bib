Our goals are (1) to highlight the usage of a cloud-computing scheme for educational purposes for a hands-on approach when learning MD simulations and (2) to exemplify how low-income research groups can perform MD simulations in the microsecond time scale. We hope this work facilitates teaching and learning of molecular simulation throughout the community.},

abstract = {With the drive toward high throughput molecular dynamics (MD) simulations involving ever-greater numbers of simulation replicates run for longer, biologically relevant timescales (microseconds), the need for improved computational methods that facilitate fully automated MD workflows gains more importance. Here we report the development of an automated workflow tool to perform AMBER GPU MD simulations. Our workflow tool capitalizes on the capabilities of the Kepler platform to deliver a flexible, intuitive, and user-friendly environment and the AMBER GPU code for a robust and high-performance simulation engine. Additionally, the workflow tool reduces user input time by automating repetitive processes and facilitates access to GPU clusters, whose high-performance processing power makes simulations of large numerical scale possible. The presented workflow tool facilitates the management and deployment of large sets of MD simulations on heterogeneous computing resources. The workflow tool also performs systematic analysis on the simulation outputs and enhances simulation reproducibility, execution scalability, and MD method development including benchmarking and validation.},

abstract = {Protein structures can provide invaluable information, both for reasoning about biological processes and for enabling interventions such as structure-based drug development or targeted mutagenesis. After decades of effort, 17\% of the total residues in human protein sequences are covered by an experimentally-determined structure1. Here we dramatically expand structural coverage by applying the state-of-the-art machine learning method, AlphaFold2, at scale to almost the entire human proteome (98.5\% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58\% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36\% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model, and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies illustrating how high-quality predictions may be used to generate biological hypotheses. Importantly, we are making our predictions freely available to the community via a public database (hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute at 
              https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/

abstract = {The proper functioning of biomolecules in living cells requires them to assume particular structures and to undergo conformational changes. Both biomolecular structure and motion can be studied using a wide variety of techniques, but none offers the level of detail as do molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Integrating two widely used modeling programs, namely NAMD and VMD, we have created a robust, user-friendly software, QwikMD, which enables novices and experts alike to address biomedically relevant questions, where often only molecular dynamics simulations can provide answers. Performing both simple and advanced MD simulations interactively, QwikMD automates as many steps as necessary for preparing, carrying out, and analyzing simulations while checking for common errors and enabling reproducibility. QwikMD meets also the needs of experts in the field, increasing the efficiency and quality of their work by carrying out tedious or repetitive tasks while enabling easy control of every step. Whether carrying out simulations within the live view mode on a small laptop or performing complex and large simulations on supercomputers or Cloud computers, QwikMD uses the same steps and user interface. QwikMD is freely available by download on group and personal computers. It is also available on the cloud at Amazon Web Services.},

@article{Fleishman2021,
abstract = {Recent progress in structure-prediction methods that rely on deep learning suggests that the atomic structure of almost any protein may soon be predictable directly from its amino acid sequence. This much-awaited revolution was driven by substantial improvements in the reliability of methods for inferring the spatial distances between amino acid pairs from an analysis of homologous sequences. Improved reliability has been accompanied, however, by a reduced ability to detect amino acid relationships that are not due to direct spatial contacts, such as those that arise from protein dynamics or allostery. Given the central importance of dynamics and allostery to protein activity, we argue that an important future advance would extend modeling beyond predicting a single static structure. Here, we briefly review some of the developments that have led to the remarkable recent achievement in structure prediction and speculate what methods and sources of information may be leveraged in the future to develop a modeling framework that addresses protein dynamics and allostery.},

The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short circuiting traditional approaches which require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking.

abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the 3-D structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence, the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem'8, has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even where no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experiment in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

abstract = {Introduction: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide not only plentiful dynamical structural information on biomacromolecules but also a wealth of energetic information about protein and ligand interactions. Such information is very important to understanding the structure-function relationship of the target and the essence of protein–ligand interactions and to guiding the drug discovery and design process. Thus, MD simulations have been applied widely and successfully in each step of modern drug discovery. Areas covered: In this review, the authors review the applications of MD simulations in novel drug discovery, including the pathogenic mechanisms of amyloidosis diseases, virtual screening and the interaction mechanisms between drugs and targets. Expert opinion: MD simulations have been used widely in investigating the pathogenic mechanisms of diseases caused by protein misfolding, in virtual screening, and in investigating drug resistance mechanisms caused by mutations of the target. These issues are very difficult to solve by experimental methods alone. Thus, in the future, MD simulations will have wider application with the further improvement of computational capacity and the development of better sampling methods and more accurate force fields together with more efficient analysis methods.},

@article{Hollingsworth2018,
abstract = {The impact of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in molecular biology and drug discovery has expanded dramatically in recent years. These simulations capture the behavior of proteins and other biomolecules in full atomic detail and at very fine temporal resolution. Major improvements in simulation speed, accuracy, and accessibility, together with the proliferation of experimental structural data, have increased the appeal of biomolecular simulation to experimentalists—a trend particularly noticeable in, although certainly not limited to, neuroscience. Simulations have proven valuable in deciphering functional mechanisms of proteins and other biomolecules, in uncovering the structural basis for disease, and in the design and optimization of small molecules, peptides, and proteins. Here we describe, in practical terms, the types of information MD simulations can provide and the ways in which they typically motivate further experimental work. Hollingsworth and Dror review modern molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with an emphasis on how such simulations complement wet-lab experiments. MD simulations capture biomolecular motion in atomic detail and have come into widespread use because of recent technological and scientific advances.},

OSSCAR provides an open collaborative environment to develop and access educational resources in the form of web applications, for which various deployment methods are discussed and compared. To minimize efforts in the creation and use of new educational material, OSSCAR combines software tools that have emerged as standards with custom domain-specific ones. The technical solutions adopted to create and distribute content are described and motivated on the basis of reliability, sustainability, ease of uptake and use. Examples from courses in the domains of physics, chemistry, and materials science are shown to demonstrate the style and level of interactivity of typical applications. The tools presented are easy to use, and create a uniform and open environment exploitable by a large community of teachers, students, and researchers with the goal of facilitating learning and avoiding, when possible, duplication of efforts in creating teaching material. Contributions to expand the educational content of the OSSCAR project are welcome.
Program summary
Program Title: OSSCAR Interactive Notebooks for Quantum Mechanics and Computational Materials Science CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/26py5zz9f8.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/osscar-org/quantum-mechanics Licensing provisions: MIT Programming language: Python Nature of problem: Among others, computational courses (e.g. on quantum mechanics) can benefit from advanced interactive visualizations of the content. However, on the one hand it might be complicated for teachers to develop such interactive content; on the other hand, students need to be able to access very quickly and efficiently the content, reducing the time needed to install libraries and dependencies that might differ between courses. Solution method: Here, we developed interactive web applications to complement teaching and encourage computational thinking for courses in computational physics, chemistry and materials science, using Jupyter notebooks and their rendering as interactive web applications. The latter is powered by a combination of Voila, to hide code and convert notebooks into live web applications, and (existing or custom) Jupyter widgets to enable interactiveness. The code is ready to be deployed via a number of open approaches.}

Our goals for this online conference series have always been: (1) Availability; (2) Community building and (3) Supporting young scientists. In this article, we highlight the motivations behind our initiative, how this has influenced the organisation of our online meeting, and discuss the benefits as well as the drawbacks of virtual meetings. Virtual conferences may not fully replace in-person meetings, but they are rapidly becoming an accepted alternative format. We discuss the hybrid online/in-person conference format as a future possibility that may offer an opportunity to reduce the environmental impact and accessibility barriers associate with in-person meetings without comprising networking and community-building opportunities.}
